Attitude Cube
===
A web app that shows a rotating cube. If viewed on a mobile device with motion sensors, shows a cube that rotates in response to the motion of the device, indicating its attitude and displaying the sensor data.


Tested on my old iPhone 4, probably wont work on much else.


On a desktop browser just displays a rotating cube screensaver.
